# DIY-car-audio-bluetooth-AUX

Based on a $2.5 Bluetooth audio receiver bought online I was able to build a device that draws power from the 12V car battery and connects to the proprietary 'AUX+' connector of an Alpine headunit so that I have bluetooth audio streaming to my 17 year old car without major investments. I also had to use a switching power supply to drop the 12V to the @5V the bluetooth receiver used and had to short out the 'control' button so that it is always active when the Alpine unit is powered. Finally i covered it in some plastic 'sponge' material and some heatshrink tubing to protect it.
